# RideWatch

> Logistics tracking that lives in WhatsApp.

## About
RideWatch is a lightweight, offline-first logistics tracking platform built for emerging markets (specifically Lagos, Nigeria). It allows vendors to generate tracking links for their riders and send them directly to customers via WhatsApp.

## Core Value Propositions
- **Zero Install**: Neither the rider nor the customer needs to download an app. Everything runs in the browser.
- **Offline First**: The rider app (PWA) works offline, caching coordinates and syncing when the network returns.
- **Battery Efficient**: Optimized for OLED screens (Dark Mode default) and low-end devices.
- **WhatsApp Centric**: The primary interface for customers is a shared link in WhatsApp.

## Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JS + Tailwind CSS (No heavy frameworks for rider/customer views).
- **Backend / Realtime**: Firebase Realtime Database.
- **Hosting**: Vercel / Firebase Hosting.
